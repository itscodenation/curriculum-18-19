## Scope and Sequence

| Unit  | Sessions | Skills | Overview|
|-------|:-------:|------|------|
| [**0: Intro and Review**](units/unit0)| 3 | HTML, CSS, Javascript Review, Dev Tools, Git| In this unit, coders will work on team building and go over daily routines and procedures. Coders will complete a scavenger hunt to review HTML, CSS, Javascript from foundations. In the final lesson, coders will learn how to use developer tools to debug HTML and CSS code.  |
| [**1: Portfolio**](units/unit1) | 3 | Wireframing, Bootstrap, gh-pages  | In this unit, coders will create an online Portfolio. The Portfolio will provide personal information, links to their prior projects, and contact information. To create this project, coders will use bootstrap to layout their page and gh-pages to host their portfolio. |
| [**2: Rock, Paper, Scissors**](units/unit2) | 3 | jQuery, Arrays, Math Library, Conditionals|In this unit, coders will create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The Rock, Paper, Scissors game will take user choice, generate a computer choice, and display the winner to the screen. To create this project, coders will use jQuery to take user input and display data, arrays to store user choice, the Math Library to generate a random index, and conditionals determine the winner.|
| [**3: Pig Latinizer**](units/unit3) | 3 | Functions, String Methods, Array Methods, For Loops| In this unit, coders will create a Pig Latinizer. The Pig Latinizer will take a user's sentence and display the sentence in pig latin on the screen. To create this project, coders will use jQuery to take user input and display data, functions to separate concerns, string methods to separate and transform words, for loops to iterate over multiple items in an array, and array methods to add items and join items into a sentence.|
| [**4: Portfolio Object**](units/unit4) | 3 | Objects | In this unit, coders will create an object representation of their Portfolio page.  With this update to their portfolio, all of the displayed information will be generated from a JavaScipt object. To create this project, coders will create an object representation of their portfolio, navigate the object, and display information to the screen. |
| [**5: Playlist**](units/unit5) | 3 | Array of Objects, Iteration, Enumeration|In this unit, coders will create a Playlist. The Playlist will display a list of information about different songs with images and links to play the songs. To create this project, coders will create an array of songs objects, use a for loop to iterate over the array of object, and display data to the screen using jQuery.|
| [**Midyear Review**](units/mid) | 1 | Review, HackerRank | On this day, coders will take a coding challenge that will assess their mastery of the skills that have been taught up until this point in the course.|
| [**6: Giphy App**](units/unit6) | 3 | API, GET, AJAX, JSON | In this unit, coders will create a Giphy App. The Giphy App will take a search term as an input and display a random Gif in a thumbnail on the screen.  To create this project, coders will learn the anatomy of an API Request, use AJAX to make a simple get request, handle a JSON response object, use jQuery to display a gif image.|
| [**7: Civic Info App**](units/unit7)| 3 | API, Documentation, Postman, Request Body| In this unit, coders will create a Civic Info App. The Civic Info App will take an address and display all of the elected representatives realted to that address. To create this project, students will use AJAX to make a get request witha body parameter, handle a JSON response object, and use jQuery to display multiple objects to the screen.|
| [**8: Client Project**](units/unit8) | 5 | Review, Project Management| In this unit, coders create a Client Project. Coders will work in pairs to create a project for a client based on a given set of API's. This is a culminating project that incorporates all of the skills that have been taught in the course and is intended to highlight some important aspects of goal setting and project management.  |
| [**EOY Wrap Up**](units/eoy) | 2 | Hackerrank, Survey, Celebration | In this unit, coders will close out the year with a culminating Hackerrank challege, end-of-year Survey, and class celebration.|
